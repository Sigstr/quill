summary: Size is used as a modifier for several components in Quill. There are currently 5 options for size - Micro, Small, Regular, Large, and Jumbo. Micro has a height of 1rem, Small has a height of 2rem, Regular has a height of 2.5rem, Large has a height of 3rem, and Jumbo has a height of 5rem. Not all components that offer a size modifier give the option for all 5 sizes. For example, the tabs component has sizes of regular and large, and the buttons component only offers sizes of small, regular, and large.
