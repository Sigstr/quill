title: Spacing
slug: spacing
type: foundation
summary: Spacing guidelines are instituted to promote a consistent and well-design UI. These guidelines also eliminate additional cognitive load when designing the UI. For example - you will not have to decide between putting 7px or 8px between items, as the system works on a base of 8px.

## The rule of 8s
Most of the components in the design system follow the rule of 8s. This rule establishes a consistent look and feel across the UI. When spacing components in the app, whether vertically or horizontally, most of them have 8px, 16px, 24px or 32px between them and other items. The rule of 8s can be seen applied to padding within components as well.

## Spacing items adjacent to text
An example that deviates from the rule of 8s would be items associated with text as seen in several components. In small buttons, where the text is 12px, and icon is always spaced 4px from it, whether on the left or right side. 6px is between text and icons with a font size of 14px. In large buttons, sanity is restored - as 8px of space is between text and icons.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Font Size</th>
    <th>Spacing</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>12px</td>
    <td>4px</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>14px</td>
    <td>6px</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>16px</td>
    <td>8px</td>
  </tr>
</table>
