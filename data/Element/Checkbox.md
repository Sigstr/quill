title: Checkbox
slug: checkbox
type: component
summary: Use checkboxes to allow users to select a number of options. This includes no options, a single option or multiple. Each checkbox is independent of all other checkboxes in the list, and checking one box doesn't uncheck the others. Checkboxes require the use of a button to apply the settings once they are selected.
