title: Toggle
slug: toggle
type: component
summary: Toggles are binary controls that enable or disable functionality in the UI. Interaction with toggles should take immediate effect and not require an additional control to save their states. Accompanying labels should be clear and direct so the user easily understands the outcome of the interaction.
