## Accessiblity considerations
* Icons without adjacent text require a title attribute to explain their purpose in contrast with vanity icons that repeat or clarify the meaning of adjacent text.
* Icons should not be smaller than 10px.
* If inlining the SVG, add `role="img"` so screenreaders don't skip over it.
* Icon tooltips should have a `<title>` as the first item of the SVG which should become.
